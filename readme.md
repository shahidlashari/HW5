Description:

The purpose of this assignment was to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

The aim was If an employee with a busy schedule wants to add important events to a daily planner so that he can manage his time effectively.

While using a daily planner to create a schedule, open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar, scroll down timeblocks for standard business hours
is presented.View the timeblocks for that day,each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Now click into a timeblock and an event can be entered then click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage. If the page is refreshed the saved events persists.

The Day Calender page is done through HTML, CSS, and JQuery in Visual Studio Code, and utilizes Bootstrap with its components and utilities. There is also momentjs.com library to get date and time functions. The css file contains standard css practices , whereas the javascript file contains variables functions, for-loops, arrays and if-else statements. JSON.parse and JSON.stringify function is used to get the stored data from local storage and set the data to localm storage.

Technologies:

.HTML
.CSS 
.JQuery
.Bootstrap
.Visual Studio Code

Challenges:

This activity was difficult though but having concept of DOM and Local storage made it a bit easy. I started my pseudo-code to work with .I went through lecture videos and also looking through a couple of examples online in order to understand jQuery code and day,date and time functions.
